INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE

### Step 1: create data files (from crawl file) with the following information (one for each extractor), INCLUDING a header:
file\_path,extraction\_time,extraction\_size,file\_size

### Step 2: change the bottom of Regressor.py to contain all possible extractors. 

### Step 3: change the minimum 'r' values in each (right now, I believe the cutoff is r >= 0.4

### Step 4: Simply run `Regressor.py`
